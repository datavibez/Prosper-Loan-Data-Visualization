# (Prosper Loan Data Exploration)
## by (Ayodele Oluwatosin Joy)


## Dataset

> This project is my final project in my Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. it is divided into two major parts where I first conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis on the ProsperLoanDataset.The ProsperLoanDataset explores a dataset containing 113,937 loans(rows) with 81 variables (columns )on each loan,  including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan  status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit  history, and the latest payment information. In which I used Python data science and data visualisation libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. For my first aspect I structured the analysis to address the simple univariate relationships , the bivariate relationships snd the lastly the multivariate relationships. In the second part of my analysis , I summarised the characteristics of  variables that can affect the loan status and to get both the univariate, bivariate and the multivariate relationships using summary statistics and exploratory visualisation above then I went ahead to convey into an Explanatory Analysis.

## Summary of Findings

> I'm most interested in figuring out what features are best for predicting the borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for the loan they took from prosper loan company, and how employment status,debt To Income ratio,and other features in this data set associates with various metrics. After analyzing each variables,i found out that the distribution of borrower Annual Percentage Rate (APR) looks multimodal. The correlation coefficient of borrower APR and loan original amount is a negative correlation,when the borrower Annual Percentage Rate (APR) decreases there is an increase in the borrowers loan amount.the scatter plot also shows that these two variables are negatively correlated as well,the Debt To Income Ratio have a Weak positive correlation to the borrower Annual Percentage Rate (APR),the borrower Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and ProsperScore have a stronger negative correlation, which also means borrowers with lower prosper score are more likely to pay higher borrower Annual Percentage Rate (APR).The loan term that Prosper offer the borrowers that come to borrow are divided into 3 sections which is either 1 year (12 month) or 3 years (36 months) or 5 years (60 months) and its safe to say the length of most of the loans are 36 months whicch is 3 years because it has the higest value count of 53000. for the employment status;the borrowers who are Employed followed by those with fulltime will take larger loans than other in the employment status.But there is a Relationship between the loan term and Prosper rating of the borrowers. Proportionally, there are more 60 month loans terms on B and C prosper ratings and on the HR prosper rating there is only only 36 months loan term.There is a strong positive relationship between loan term and loan original amount, the longer the term of the loan the larger the loan a borrower can borrow.From all above visualizations created from univariate exploration to multivariate exploration, many variable are found to be negatively correlated to BorrowerAPR, but the borrower apr and the lender yield are directly positively correlated and the ProspoerScore also has a strong negative correlation with borrower APR. Outside of the main variables of interest, I found that there is a relationship between the borrower's income range and the investor's estimated returns, such that as the borrowers income increases, the estimated return decreases in number as well,its save to say when there is increase in borrowers income there is positive ability to repay the loan,which also mean for a particular credit income we have a range of possible estimated returns.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I'm most interested in figuring out what features are best for predicting the borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for the loan they took from prosper loan company, so i just focus on features on the data set that could affect the borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which are Prosper rating, Prosper score, the original loan amount and other features i checked out. I started by showing the general distribution of the borrower APR and loan amount variable. Afterwards, I introduce each of the categorical variables one by one in the Univariate Exploration. then i continued with the Bivariate Exploration, To start, I plotted a scatter plots just to show the relationship between borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and the original loan amount, then i use the boxplot plots to check the relationship between the Borrower APR on the Employment Status,Prosper rating and also between income range and estimated return. went ahead to use scatter plot for ploting the relationship between the borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and the prosper Score.check for the relationship between the Loan original amount and the Employment Status.and also used the Multivariate Exploration to explore the relationship between features on the data set that best for my predicting and conclusion on the borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR).
